                System modeling is the process of developing abstract models of a system, with each model presenting a different view or perspective of that system. It means representing a system using a same kind of graphical notation that is based in the unified modeling language.
                Models are used during the requirements engineering process to help drive the requirements for the systems. Models can be for both the existing system and the system to be developed.
                Models of the existing system. These are used during requirement engineering to clarify what the existing system does and can be as a basis for discussing its strengths and weaknesses.
                Models of the new system. These are used during requirements engineering to explain the proposed requirements to other system stake holders.
